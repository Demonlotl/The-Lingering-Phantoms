        <p>The Lingering Phantoms, a game inspired by the Backrooms. This game is about a skyscraper that has 522 floors. 
            You'll start from the top floor travelling to the bottom. When you get to floor 521 and below, you will start
            encountering... phantoms. Each floor's phantom differs from each other, sometimes one can be a combination of all sorts. It is also
            a multiplayer game so you can join your friends and have fun. The game is also a 3-dimensional game, so you can
            have a 360 view of what your surrounding is.</p>

        <p>This phantom is one of the few titans that will chase you slowly. It only spawns in level 0 (The Exit?). 
            Do not stop running! </p>

        <h2>Phantom 1</h2>
        <img class="phacls" src="tlp2.png">
        <p>Theses human sized phantoms will walk towards you. One touch, and you're gone! And by the way, you will not find these
            wiered biengs anywhere other than level 1 (The Maze). The origin of them were to be minion sized phantoms 
            until one of our beta tester said that the phantoms were too small. Hilarious!

        <h2>Phantom 2</h2>
        <img class="phacls" src="tlp3.png">
        <p>Finding a smiling face in the dark? Thats creepy! It will all end once you get into The Maze. Until then, you're
            stuck with the only dark boy in level 2 (Loneliness).</p>

        <h2>Phantom 3</h2>
        <img class="phacls" src="tlp4.png">
        <p>Dang! Thats one goofy titan. This titan's origin says that he was supposed to be with his friends. But for some reason
            he's the only one left. The lonely one in level 3 (Dang! Thats A Goofy One!)</p>

        <img class="phacls" src="tlp5.png">
        <p>Travelling through the dotty walls and... someone left their mouth in the air. The first phantom to not have a
            body is found in level 4 (Someone Left Their Mouth!)</p>

        <img class="phacls" src="tlp6.png">
        <p>Oh my! This phantom got executed. His head is here, but where's his body? Headless one in level 5 (The Invisible Maze)</p>
